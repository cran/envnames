#' Create a lookup table with address-name pairs of environments
#' 
#' Return a data frame containing the address-name pairs of system, package, namespace, user-defined,
#' and function execution environments in the whole workspace or within a given environment.
#' 
#' The table includes the empty environment as well when the address-name pairs map is constructed
#' on the whole workspace.
#' 
#' @param envir environment where environments are searched for to construct the lookup table.
#' It defaults to \code{NULL} which means that all environments in the whole workspace should be searched for
#' and all packages in the \code{search()} path should be returned including their namespace environments.
#' @param include_functions flag indicating whether to include in the returned data frame 
#' user-defined environments defined inside function execution environments.
#' 
#' @details
#' The search for environments is recursive, meaning that a search is carried out for environments defined
#' within other user-defined environments and, when \code{include_functions=TRUE} within function execution
#' environments.
#' 
#' The search within packages is always on \emph{exported objects} only.
#' 
#' If \code{envir=NULL} the lookup table includes all system, package, and namespace environments
#' in the \code{search()} path, as well as all user-defined found in \emph{any} of those environments
#' (with recursive search), and all function execution environments.
#'
#' If \code{envir} is not \code{NULL} the lookup table includes just the user-defined and
#' function execution environments found inside the given environment (with recursive search).
#' 
#' @return A data frame containing the following seven columns:
#' \itemize{
#' \item{\code{type}} type of environment ("user" for user-defined environments,
#' "function" for function execution environments, "system/package" for system or package environments,
#' "namespace" for namespace environments, and "empty" for empty environments such as emptyenv()).
#' \item{\code{location}} location of the environment, which is only non-\code{NA} for user-defined
#' and function execution environments: 
#'    \itemize{
#'    \item for a user-defined environment, the location is the system environment or package where
#'    the environment resides (note that this may be different from the parent environment if the
#'    parent environment was set during creation with the \code{parent=} option of the \code{new.env()}
#'    function or using the \code{parent.env()} function)
#'    \item for a function execution environment, the location is the function's enclosing environment, i.e. the environment
#'    where the function is defined.
#'    }
#' \item{\code{locationaddress}} the memory address of the \code{location} environment.
#' \item{\code{address}} memory address of the environment. This is the key piece of information used
#' by the package to retrieve the environment name with the \code{environment_name()} function.
#' For functions, this is the address of the function's execution environment.
#' \item{\code{pathname}} path to the environment and its name. This is the combination of columns
#' \code{path} and \code{name} whose values are put together separated by \code{$}.
#' \item{\code{path}} path to the environment (i.e. all environments that need to be traversed in order
#' to reach the environment).
#' \item{\code{name}} name of the environment.
#' }
#' The \code{type} column is used to distinguish between user-defined environments, function execution
#' environments, package or system environments, namespace environments, and empty environments.
#' 
#' The data frame is empty if no environments are found in the given \code{envir} environment.
#' 
#' \code{NULL} is returned when an error occurs.
