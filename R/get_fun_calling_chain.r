#' Return the chain of calling functions
#' 
#' Return a data frame with the stack or chain of function calls, or optionally the information on one
#' particular function in this chain.
#' 
#' @param n non-negative integer specifying the level of interest in the function calling chain,
#' where 0 means the function calling \code{get_fun_calling_chain}.
#' It defaults to \code{NULL}, in which case the full chain is returned.
#' @param showParameters flag indicating whether the parameters of the function call should also be shown
#' in the output.
#' @param silent whether to run in silent mode. If FALSE, the calling chain is shown in an intuitive way.
#' It defaults to \code{TRUE}.
#' 
#' @return 
#' If \code{n=NULL} (the default) a data frame with the function calling chain information, 
#' with the following columns:
#' \itemize{
#' \item{\code{fun}:} the function name (including parameters if \code{showParameters=TRUE})
#' \item{\code{env}:} the function's enclosing enviroment, i.e. the environment where the function is defined
#' as returned by \code{environment(<function>)}
#' \item{\code{envfun}:} the environment where the function is defined together with the function name (and its parameters
#' if \code{showParameters=TRUE}) separated by a \code{$} sign. Ex: \code{env1$f()}
#' }
#' The rownames of the data frame are the stack level of the function calls in the chain,
#' from 0 up to the number of functions in the chain, where 0 indicates the current function
#' (i.e. the function that called \code{get_fun_calling_chain}).
#' 
#' The functions in the data frame are sorted from most recent to least recent call, much like the common
#' way of displaying the function stack in debug mode.
#' 
#' If the function is NOT called from within a function, \code{NULL} is returned.
#' 
#' If \code{n} is not NULL and is non-negative, the environment and the function name (including parameters
#' if \code{showParameters=TRUE}) separated by a \code{$} sign are returned (ex: \code{env1$f(x = 3, n = 1)}).
#' 
#' if \code{n < 0} or if \code{n} is larger than the function calling chain length, \code{NULL} is returned.
