#' Return the execution environment of a function
#' 
#' Return the execution environment of a function by going over the execution environments of all functions
#' in the calling chain.
#'
#' @param fun_name_or_address string containing either the name of the function of interest or the
#' memory address of the execution environment to retrieve (N.B. this sould not be the memory address
#' of the \emph{function itself}, but the memory address of its \emph{execution environment}).
#' When the function name is given, it should be given with its full path, i.e. including
#' the environment where it is defined (e.g. "env1$f") and with no arguments.
#' 
#' @details This function is expected to be called from within a function. Otherwise, the function calling chain
#' is empty and the function returns \code{NULL}.
#' 
#' @return When the input parameter is a memory address, the execution environment of the function
#' whose memory address (of the execution environment) equals the given memory address.
#' 
#' When the input parameter is a function name, a list of ALL the execution environments belonging
#' to a function whose name coincides with the given name. Note that these may be many environments
#' as the same function may be called several times in the function calling chain.
#' 
#' @examples
#' # Define the function that is called to show the behaviour of get_fun_env()
#' h <- function(x) {
#'   # Get the value of parameter 'x' in the execution environment of function 'env1$g'
#'   # If function 'env1$g' is not found, 'x' is evaluated in the current environment of function
#'   xval = evalq(x, get_fun_env("env1$g")[[1]])
#'   return(xval)
#' }
#' # Define the function that calls h() in a user-defined environment 
#' env1 <- new.env()
#' with(env1, 
#'   g <- function(y) {
#'     x = 2
#'     return( h(y) )
#'   }
#' )
#' # Call env1$g()
#' cat("The value of variable 'x' inside env1$g is", env1$g(3), "\n") 
#'   ## Prints '2', because the value of x inside env1$g() is 2
#'   ## ('3' is the value of variable 'y' in env1$g(), not of variable 'x')
#' 
#' # When get_fun_env() is called from outside a function, it returns NULL
#' get_fun_env("env1$g")  # NULL, even if function 'g' exists,
#'                        # but we are not calling get_fun_env() from a function
#' 
get_fun_env <- function(fun_name_or_address) {
  # In order to retrieve the function's execution environment, we need to go through
  # the function calling chain and find where in the chain the function is found.
  #
  # See the following interesting discussions about getting the object associated to a memory address in SO:
  # https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21965665/get-object-by-its-memory-address
  # --> it works around the question of the poster by simulating a linked list via environments!!
  # (nice approach to linked lists)
  # https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29870960/access-object-by-address-pointer
  # --> here they define a find.by.address() function but it cannot be used to get the execution environment
  # of a function! (as I want to do here)

	#----------------------------- Auxiliary functions --------------------------
	# NOTES for the next two functions about retrieving a function's execution environment:
	# 1) We use sys.frame(-level) to retrieve the function's execution environment of a calling
	# function and NOT parent.frame(level), because parent.frames may not always include internal functions in
	# the counting of parent frames (e.g. print() if we call print(get_env_names())), as explained in the Note
	# section of the documentation for sys.parent.
	# 2) We CANNOT use eval(environment(), envir=sys.frame(-level)) to do that because this just gives
	# the execution environment of the currently executed function

	# Execution environment by memory address
	# Return the function execution environment associated to the given memory address
	# calls is the object returned by sys.calls() with the function calling chain

		  # is NOT counted in the calling chain passed in input parameter calls
		  level = length(calls) - c + 1

			# Get the function's execution environment and compare its memory address with the given memory address
