#' Retrieve the name of an environment
#' 
#' Retrieve the name of an environment as the \code{\link{environmentName}} function of the base package does,
#' but extending its functionality to retrieving the names of user-defined environments and function
#' execution environments.
#' 
#' @param env environment whose name is of interest.
#' It can be given as an object of class environment, as a string with the name of the environment,
#' or as a string with the memory address of the environment.
#' The latter is useful to find out if a given memory address is the reference of an environment object.
#' Note that the variable passed may or may \emph{not} exist in the calling environment, as the purpose
#' of this function is also to search for it (and return its name if it is an environment).
#' It defaults to parent.frame(), meaning that the name of the environment that calls this function is retrieved.
#' @param envir environment where \code{env} should be searched for. When \code{NULL}, \code{env} is searched in
#' the whole workspace, including packages and user-defined environments, recursively.
#' @param envmap data frame containing a lookup table with name-address pairs of environment names and
#' addresses to be used when searching for environment \code{env}. It defaults to \code{NULL} which means that the
#' lookup table is constructed on the fly with the environments defined in the \code{envir} environment
#' --if not \code{NULL}--, or in the whole workspace if \code{envir=NULL}.
#' See the details section for more information on its structure.
#' @param matchname flag indicating whether the match for \code{env} is based on its name or on its
#' memory address. In the latter case all environments sharing the same memory address of the given
#' environment are returned. Such scenario happens when, for instance, different
#' environment objects have been defined equal to another environment (as in \code{env1 <- env}).
#' It defaults to \code{FALSE}.
#' @param ignore one or more environment names to ignore if found during the search. These environments
#' are removed from the output. It should be given as a character array if more than one environments
#' should be ignored. See the details section for more information.
#' @param include_functions flag indicating whether to look for user-defined environments inside function
#' execution environments. This should be used with care because in a complicated function chain, some function
#' execution environments may contain environments that point to other environments (e.g. the 'envclos' environment
#' in the \code{eval()} function when running tests using the \code{test_that} package).
#' 
#' @details
#' If \code{env} is an environment it is searched for in the \code{envir} environment using its memory address.
#' If \code{env} is a string containing a valid 16-digit memory address (enclosed in < >), the memory address
#' itself is searched for among the defined environments in the \code{envir} environment.
#' In both cases, if \code{envir=NULL} the search is carried out in the whole workspace. 
#'  
#' It may happen that more than one environment exist with the same memory address (for instance
#' if an environment is a copy of another environment). In such case, if \code{matchname=FALSE},
#' the names of ALL the environments matching \code{env}'s memory address are returned. Otherwise,
#' only the environments matching the given name are returned.
#' 
#' If \code{envmap} is passed it should be a data frame providing an address-name pair lookup table
#' of environments and should contain at least the following columns:
#' \itemize{
#' \item{\code{location}} for user-defined environments, the name of the environment where the environment
#' is located; otherwise \code{NA}.
#' \item{\code{pathname}} the full \emph{environment path} to reach the environment separated by \code{$}
#' (e.g. \code{"env1$env$envx"})
#' \item{\code{address}} an 8-digit (32-bit architectures) thru 16-digit (64-bit architectures) memory address
#' of the environment given in \code{pathname} enclosed in < > (e.g. \code{"<0000000007DCFB38>"}
#' (64-bit architectures))
#' Be ware that Linux Debian distributions may have a 12-digit memory address representation.
#' So the best way to know is to check a memory address by calling e.g. `address("x")`.
#' }
#' Passing an \code{envmap} lookup table is useful for speedup purposes, in case several calls to this
#' function will be performed in the context of an unchanged set of defined environments.
#' Such \code{envmap} data frame can be created by calling \link{get_env_names}.
#' Use this parameter with care, as the matrix passed may not correspond to the actual mapping of existing
#' environments to their addresses and in that case results may be different from those expected.
#' 
#' The following example illustrates the use of the \code{ignore} parameter:
#' 
#' \code{for (e in c(globalenv(), baseenv())) { print(environment_name(e, ignore="e")) }}
#' 
#' That is, we iterate on a set of environments and we don't want the loop variable (an environment itself)
#' to show up as part of the output generated by the call to \code{environment_name()}.
#' 
#' @return
#' If \code{matchname=FALSE} (the default), an array containing the names of all the environments
#' (defined in the \code{envir} environment if \code{envir} is not \code{NULL}) having the same memory address
#' as the \code{env} environment.
#' 
#' If \code{matchname=TRUE}, the environment name contained in \code{env} is used in addition to the memory
#' address to check the matched environments (potentially many if they have the same memory address)
#' so that only the environments having the same name and address as the \code{env} environment are returned.
#' Note that several environments may be found if environments with the same name are defined in
#' different environments.
#' WARNING: in this case, the name is matched exactly as the expression given in \code{env}. So for instance,
#' if \code{env=globalenv()$env1} the name \code{"globalenv()$env1"} is checked and this will not return any
#' environments since no environment can be called like that. For such scenario call the function with
#' parameter \code{env=env1} instead, or optionally with \code{env=env1} and \code{envir=globalenv()}
#' if the \code{env1} environment should be searched for just in the global environment.
#' 
#' If \code{env} is not found or it is not an environment, \code{NULL} is returned.

# 1) [DONE-2016/08/13] (2016/03/30) Add the functionality of receiving a memory address in the env parameter and retrieving
#    the environment name associated to the address (of course if the associated variable exists and is
#    an environment!). This would be useful because some functions in R return the memory address of
#    the environment (for instance when retrieving the environment where a function is defined, whenever
#    the function is defined within a user-defined environment (as in with(env1, f <- function(x) { })))
# 	 or when running e.g. options() we get a list of defined functions with the address of 
# 	 the environment where they are defined at the end of the function definition and we may want to know
#		 in which environment (name) the function is defined.
#    UPDATE: (2016/03/30) note that the returned value of e.g. environment(env1$f) in the example just given
#		 correctly returns the environment 'env1' (i.e. environment_name(environment(env1$f)) returns "env1")
