#' Crawl environments in search of other environments
#' 
#' Function that crawls a set of environments to search for environments defined within each of them

#' @param env_names array with the environment names where the search for environments is wished
#' (careful: should not contain the environment *objects* but their *names*!).

#' (e.g. an element of \code{env_path_list} could be \code{"env1$env2$env"}).

#' 
#' @details
#' This function crawls the environments defined in the \code{envir} environment and any environments
#' within those environments until no environment has been left without visit, making up an environments tree.
#' The path to each environment found is stored using the \code{$} notation as in \code{env1$env12$envx}.
#' 
#' Instead of setting the \code{envir} parameter to the root environment where the search should start,
#' a similar result is obtained by setting the \code{path} variable to the environment chain leading to
#' the environment that should be passed to \code{envir}, as in e.g. \code{c("env_of_envs", "env11")}.
#' The difference is that such environment will appear as part of the paths to the environments passed,
