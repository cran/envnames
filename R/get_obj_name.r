#' Return the name of an object referenced by a parameter at any parent generation
#' 
#' Return the name of the object at the specified parent generation leading to a function's parameter.
#' This is done by iteratively retrieving the name of the object that leads to the function's parameter
#' at each parent generation.
#' The object is optionally evaluated in the environment of the specified parent generation
#' before retrieving its name. In this case, the result is very similar to the deparse() function.
#' The differences are explained in the Details section.
#' 
#' @param obj object whose name is of interest, or whose evaluated name is of interest.
#' @param n number of parent generations to go back to retrieve the name of the object that leads to \code{obj}
#' in the function calling chain. See details for more information.
#' @param eval whether to evaluate \code{obj} in the \code{n}-th parent generation before
#' getting the object's name in that environment. See details for more information.
#' @param silent when \code{FALSE}, the names of the environments and objects in those environments are printed
#' as those environments are traversed by this function.
#' 
#' @return The name of the object in the \code{n}-th parent generation environment.
#' If the object in that parent generation is an unnamed environment, \code{"<environment>"} is returned.
#' 
#' @details To better understand the meaning of this function when \code{n} > 0, consider the first example below:  
#' Function \code{f(x)} is called with parameter \code{z}, which calls \code{g(y)} with parameter \code{x}.
#' The result of the call to \code{get_obj_name()} from function \code{g()} is \code{"z"}
#' because that call is telling "give me the name of object \code{y} two levels up from
#' the current environment, i.e. from the environment of \code{g()}. The name of \code{y} in the environment
#' of \code{f(x)} is \code{"x"}, and the name of \code{y} in the global environment is \code{"z"}.  
#' 
#' Note that one may think that the result of this function is the same as using deparse(substitute()) where the
#' object being \code{substitute}d is evaluated at the \code{n}-th parent generation. However, this is not quite so
#' because \code{substitute(obj, parent.frame(n))} retrieves the object assigned to \code{obj} at the \code{n}-th
#' parent generation, where \code{obj} \emph{is the name of the variable substituted at that \code{n}-th parent generation}.
#' On the contrary, \code{get_obj_name(obj, n=2)} \emph{first} looks for the name leading to \code{obj} and then
#' retrieves its name.
#' 
#' When eval=TRUE, the result of the function is the same as the output of \code{deparse()} except for the following two cases:
#' \itemize{
#' \item the result of \code{NULL} is \code{NULL} instead of \code{"NULL"} which is the case with \code{deparse()}
#' \item when \code{eval=TRUE}, if the object passed to \code{get_obj_name()} evaluates to a name, it returns that name,
#' without added quotes. For example, if \code{v = "x"} then \code{get_obj_name(v, eval=TRUE)} returns \code{"x"} while
#' \code{deparse(v)} returns \code{"\"x\""}.

#' @examples
#' # In its default behaviour (eval=FALSE), get_obj_name() returns
#' # the name of an object in the n-th parent generation.
