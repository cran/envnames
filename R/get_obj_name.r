#' Return the name of an object at a given parent generation from an environment
#' 
#' A practical use of this function is to retrieve the name of the object leading to
#' a function's parameter in the function calling chain, at any parent generation.
#' 
#' In particular, it provides a handy way of retrieving the name of a function's parameter
#' and use it in e.g. messages to the user describing the arguments received by the function.
#' In this context, it is a shortcut to calling \code{as.list(environment())}, which returns
#' a list of parameter names and parameter values.
#' See the Examples section for an illustration.
#' 
#' @param obj object whose name at a given parent generation is of interest.
#' @param n number of parent generations to go back from the calling environment
#' to retrieve the name of the object that leads to \code{obj}
#' in the function calling chain. See details for more information.
#' @param eval whether to evaluate \code{obj} in the \code{n}-th parent generation before
#' getting the object's name in that environment. See details for more information.
#' @param silent when \code{FALSE}, the names of the environments and objects in those environments are printed
#' as those environments are traversed by this function.
#' 
#' @return The name of the object in the \code{n}-th parent generation environment.
#' 
#' @details 
#' This function goes back to each parent generation from the calling function's environment
#' and at each of those parent generations it retrieves the name of the object that is part of
#' the parameter chain leading to the calling function's parameter.
#' 
#' To illustrate: suppose we call a function \code{f <- function(x)} by running the piece of code \code{f(z)},
#' and that \code{f} calls another function \code{g <- function(y)} by running the piece of code \code{g(x)}.  
#' 
#' That is, we have the parameter chain:  
#' \code{z -> x -> y}
#' 
#' If, inside function \code{g()}, we call \code{get_obj_name()} as follows, we obtain respectively:  
#' \code{get_obj_name(y, n=1)} yields \code{"x"}
#' \code{get_obj_name(y, n=2)} yields \code{"z"}
#' 
#' because these calls are telling "give me the name of object \code{y} as it was called
#' \code{n} levels up from the calling environment --i.e. from the environment of \code{g()}.
#' 
#' Note that the results of these two calls are different from making the following two
#' \code{deparse(substitute())} calls:  
#' \code{deparse(substitute(y, parent.frame(n=1)))}   
#' \code{deparse(substitute(y, parent.frame(n=2)))}
#' because these calls simply \code{substitute} or evaluate \code{y} at the \code{n}-th parent generation.
#' If \code{y} is not defined at those parent generations, the \code{substitute()} calls return
#' simply \code{"y"}.
#' 
#' On the contrary, the previous two calls to \code{get_obj_name()} return the name of the object
#' in the parameter chain (\code{z -> x -> y}) \emph{leading} to \code{y}, which is a quite different
#' piece of information.
#' 
#' When eval=TRUE, the result is the same as the result of \code{deparse()}
#' except for the following three cases:
#' \itemize{
#' \item if the object passed to \code{get_obj_name()} evaluates to a name, it returns that name,
#' without any added quotes. For example, if \code{v = "x"} then \code{get_obj_name(v, eval=TRUE)} returns \code{"x"}
#' while \code{deparse(v)} returns \code{"\"x\""}.
#' \item the result of \code{NULL} is \code{NULL} instead of \code{"NULL"} which is the case with \code{deparse()}.
#' \item the result of a non-existent object is \code{NULL}, while \code{deparse()} returns an error stating
#' that the object does not exist.
#' }
#' 
#' When \code{get_obj_name} operates on non-existent objects it works at follows:
#' \itemize{
#' \item when \code{eval=FALSE} it returns the name of the non-existent object
#' enclosed in quotes (e.g. \code{get_obj_name(nonexistent)} returns \code{"nonexistent"}, assuming \code{nonexistent}
#' does not exist).
#' \item when \code{eval=TRUE} it returns NULL.
#' }
#' 
#' Finally \code{get_obj_name(NULL)} returns \code{NULL}, while \code{as.character(NULL)} returns \code{as.character(0)}.

#' @examples
#' # Example 1:
#' # This example shows the difference between using get_obj_name() and deparse(substitute())
#' g <- function(y) { return(list(obj_name=get_obj_name(y, n=2, silent=FALSE), 
#'                                substitute=deparse(substitute(y, parent.frame(n=2))) )) }
#' f <- function(x) { g(x) }
#' z = 3; 
#' f(z)           # After showing the names of objects as they
#'                # are traversed in the parameter chain (silent=FALSE),
#'                # this function returns a list where
#'                # the first element (result of get_obj_name()) is "z"
#'                # and the second element (result of deparse(substitute())) is "y".
#'                # Note that 'z' is the object leading to object 'y'
#'                # inside function g() if we follow the parameter names
#'                # leading to 'y' in the function calling chain.
#'
#' # Example 2:
#' # When eval=TRUE, get_obj_name() behaves the same way as deparse()
#' # (except for the cases noted in the Details section)
#' # because the values of all objects linked by the parameter chain
#' # are ALL the same.
#' g <- function(y) { return(list(obj_name=get_obj_name(y, n=2, eval=TRUE),
#'                                deparse=deparse(y))) }
#' f <- function(x) { g(x) }
#' z = 3 
#' f(z)           # Returns a list where both elements are equal to "3"
#'                # because the output of get_obj_name() with eval=TRUE
#'                # and deparse() are the same.
#'
#' # Example 3:
#' # This example shows how we can use get_obj_name() to get the parameter names
#' # of non '...' parameters, which are then used in messages to the user.
#' # The advantage of using get_obj_name() as opposed to the hard-coded parameter name
#' # is that an error is raised if the parameter does not exist.
#' # An example is also shown that uses as.list(environment()), which clearly is more
#' # general... get_obj_name() should be used when referring to a couple of specific
#' # parameters.

  # get_obj_name() is enclosed in a print() function: in such case, sys.frame(-n) will include the print() environment
  # in the chain when looking for environment n levels back, while parent.frame(n) will NOT --and this is what we want,
