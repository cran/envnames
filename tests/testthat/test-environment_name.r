# Environments in .GlobalEnv: Note the need to specifically require the environment to be created in .GlobalEnv
# either by calling with() or assign() as shown below.
# In fact when running this program through devtools::test() or through CTRL+SHIF+T in RStudio, anything
# defined in this code is NOT part of the global environment, but part of the function where this code
# gets inserted to or run from!
# This can be seen from the lines at the end of devtools::test() which call test code in the test_dir
# directory:
# ns_env <- load_all(pkg, quiet = TRUE)$env
# env <- new.env(parent = ns_env)
# with_envvar(r_env_vars(), testthat::test_dir(test_path, filter = filter, env = env, ...))
# Note that function with_envvar() was originally part of the devtools package but is now part of
# the withr package, which is "A set of functions to run code 'with' safely and temporarily
# modified global state." (Ref: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/withr/withr.pdf)
